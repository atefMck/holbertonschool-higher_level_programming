This is a doctest based regression suite for 0-add_integer.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> add_integer = __import__('0-add_integer').add_integer
>>> print(add_integer(1, 2))

>>> print(add_integer(100, -2))

>>> print(add_integer(2))

>>> print(add_integer(100.3, -2))

>>> try:

b must be an integer
>>> try:
