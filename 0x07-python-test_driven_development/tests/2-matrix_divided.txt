This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> matrix = [
... [1, 2, 3],
... [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 4))
[[0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [1.0, 1.25, 1.5]]
