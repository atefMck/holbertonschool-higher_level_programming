This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
>>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
My name is John Smith
>>> say_my_name("Walter", "White")
My name is Walter White
>>> say_my_name("Bob") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
My name is Bob
>>> try:
...   say_my_name(12, "Smith")
... except Exception as e:
...   print(e)
first_name must be a string
