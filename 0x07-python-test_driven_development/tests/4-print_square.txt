This is a doctest based regression suite for 4-print_square.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
