This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> MyList = __import__('1-my_list').MyList
>>> newList = MyList()
>>> newList.append(4)
>>> newList.append(1)
>>> newList.append(3)
>>> newList.append(0)
>>> newList.append(9)
>>> print(newList)
[4, 1, 3, 0, 9]
>>> newList.print_sorted()
[0, 1, 3, 4, 9]
